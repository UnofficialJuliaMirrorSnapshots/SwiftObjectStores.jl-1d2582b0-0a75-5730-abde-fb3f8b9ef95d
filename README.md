# SwiftObjectStores


>Swift is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store. Organizations can use Swift to store lots of data efficiently, safely, and cheaply.


Makes [Open Stack Swift Object Stores](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/) available from within Julia.
This package wraps the Python Swift Client, but makes significant changes in terms of interface.


The implementation makes significant uses of temporary files.
It is thus desirable to ensure your `TMPDIR` is set to be on a RAM disk.
In most modern unixen, this is done by adding `export TMPDIR=/dev/shm` to your `.bashrc` or similar.
The package will work fine without this -- and depending on your OS may effectively use a RAM disk anyway.

#### Notice:
I no longer have free access to any swift object store service provider,
so I can no longer perform the integration tests used for this package.
As such my ability to maintain this package moving forward is limitted.

In general, I have switched to mounting the object store as a file-system.
E.g. with [svfs](https://github.com/ovh/svfs).
While this has some pecularatities (e.g. running `ls` is expensive, so tab completion is slow),
it is really quiet handly, and works well with julia code that has been written to expect paths to be provided as strings to a local filesystem.

## Installation

```julia
Pkg.add("SwiftObjectStores")
```

This will install the package, and its python reqs, if you are using Conda for your python install.
If you are not using Conda, the on screen instructions will tell you what is neeeded.



## Examples of use:

In all these examples, assume we have already loaded the package, and set up a server description:

```julia
julia> using SwiftObjectStores
julia> serv = SwiftService()
```
This constructs the default server connection description.
Reading the server URL, and your identity information from the enviroment variables, as is the Open Stack fasion.
If you want to make use of this feature, you should  `source ~/openrc.sh` or similar, before starting julia.

## Using Storing and Retrieving arbitary data objects via JLD

We expose the capacity for storing, and retieving arbitary julia object, through JLD.

We store them, by name and to value, using keyword arguents
```julia
julia> put_jld(serv, "testing-out-swift-container", "usefulobject"; data = rand(Complex128, 10), note="Stored some random numbers for later")
```

As when using JLD on files, we can retrieve each field one at a time:

```julia
julia>get_jld(serv, "testing-out-swift-container", "usefulobject", "note")

"Stored some random numbers for later"

julia>get_jld(serv, "testing-out-swift-container", "usefulobject", "data")

10-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
0.37839+0.805684im
0.300178+0.318451im
0.240708+0.331851im
0.0149401+0.806278im
0.416414+0.825936im
0.63335+0.239163im
0.661586+0.242519im
0.640306+0.611966im
0.538004+0.123092im
0.749919+0.861574im
```

or all at once:

```julia
julia>get_jld(serv, "testing-out-swift-container", "usefulobject")

Dict{String,Any} with 2 entries:
    "note" => "Stored some random numbers for later"
    "data" => Complex{Float64}[0.37839+0.805684im,0.300178+0.318451im,0.240708+0.â€¦
```

### Get a file, and perform a loading operation on it
Use [RData.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/RData.jl/) to load a RData file off the object store.
Using the container `ResearchData`, the pseudodir `simulated`, and the object name `sim-100000.RData`.
Note that the pseudodir is part of the object name -- pseudodir's are not real, just convention in the key value store.

```julia
julia> using RData
julia> data = get_file(serv, "ResearchData", "simulated/sim-100000.RData") do fn
    load(fn)
end
```

## Management:

### Deleting object, and containers

Delete an object in a container:

```julia
julia> delete(serv, "testing-out-swift-container", "usefulobject")
```

Delete the container itself:

```julia
julia> delete(serv, "testing-out-swift-container")
```



### Listing Containers

the `list` command gives a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the containers, and the values contain information about each.

```julia
julia> SwiftObjectStores.list(serv) |> keys

Base.KeyIterator for a Dict{String,Dict{Any,Any}} with 11 entries. Keys:
  "testing-out-swift-container_segments"
  "ResearchData"
  "testing-out-swift-container"
```

Notice, segment containers are also listed.
